potential security risks or Security Concerns


Port 53/tcp – DNS (Domain Name System)  :

DNS services can introduce several security risks if not properly configured:

- DNS Cache Poisoning : Attackers can inject false DNS records to redirect users to malicious websites.

- Zone Transfer Exposure : If zone transfers are allowed, an attacker can enumerate all DNS records of the domain.

- DNS Amplification Attacks : Open DNS resolvers can be used in large-scale DDoS attacks.

- Information Disclosure : May reveal internal hostnames and IP structure useful for further exploitation.



Port 80/tcp – HTTP (Web Server) :

- Unsecured Admin Interfaces : Web UIs for routers or IoT devices may be exposed without authentication.

- Weak or Default Credentials : Admin or similar defaults are often forgotten and can be easily exploited.

- Vulnerable Web Applications : Outdated CMS or scripts may contain known vulnerabilities like:

  XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

  LFI (Local File Inclusion)

  RCE (Remote Code Execution)

  SQL Injection

Lack of Encryption (No HTTPS) : Data sent over HTTP can be intercepted or altered by attackers (man-in-the-middle).
