# Task1scan
 Learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand  network exposure. 



Overview of Steps Performed
This project demonstrates basic network scanning using Nmap in Kali Linux. Below is a summary of the steps I followed:

Environment Setup: Used Kali Linux with pre-installed Nmap.

 Identified Local IP Range: Ran ipconfig on Windows to determine the subnet (e.g., 192.168.18.0/24).

 Performed TCP SYN Scan: Used nmap -sS to scan the network for live hosts and open ports.

 Analyzed Open Ports: Researched common services on open ports and potential security risks (e.g., DNS on port 53, HTTP on port 80).

 Documented Evidence: Added screenshots and scan files to the repository.

 Report Created: A markdown report detailing the analysis.
