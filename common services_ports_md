Service Research on Open Ports


Port 53 - DNS : 

-DNS is responsible for resolving domain names to IP addresses , Often runs on internal or  public DNS servers or router-based services

- Commonly runs DNS resolver software (e.g., BIND, dnsmasq , Unbound , Microsoft DNS)
- Can be abused for:
  - DNS poisoning
  - Information leakage via zone transfer
  - Amplification in DDoS attacks
- Will test further with `dns-zone-transfer` Nmap script

Port 80 - HTTP  : 

- Likely a web interface or service hosted internally
- May expose login panels or configuration UIs
- If outdated or misconfigured:
  - Can be vulnerable to XSS, RCE, directory traversal
  - No HTTPS = data is exposed in plaintext
- Will investigate with `http-enum` and browser-based testing
